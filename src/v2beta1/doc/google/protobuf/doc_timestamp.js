/**
 * A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone
 * or calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at
 * nanosecond resolution in UTC Epoch time. It is encoded using the
 * Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar
 * backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60
 * seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second
 * table is needed for interpretation. Range is from
 * 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z.
 * By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to
 * and from  RFC 3339 date strings.
 * See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.
 *
 *     Timestamp timestamp;
 *     timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));
 *     timestamp.set_nanos(0);
 *
 * Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.
 *
 *     struct timeval tv;
 *     gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
 *
 *     Timestamp timestamp;
 *     timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
 *     timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);
 *
 * Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.
 *
 *     FILETIME ft;
 *     GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
 *     UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;
 *
 *     // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z
 *     // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
 *     Timestamp timestamp;
 *     timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
 *     timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
 *
 * Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
 *
 *     long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
 *
 *     Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
 *         .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
 *
 *
 * Example 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
 *
 *     timestamp = Timestamp()
 *     timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
 *
 * # JSON Mapping
 *
 * In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
 * [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the
 * format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z"
 * where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},
 * {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
 * seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
 * are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
 * is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
 *
 * For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
 * 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
 *
 * In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the
 * standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString]
 * method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted
 * to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime)
 * with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one
 * can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](https://cloud.google.com
 * http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime())
 * to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
 *
 * @property {number} seconds
 *   Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch
 *   1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Must be from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
 *   9999-12-31T23:59:59Z inclusive.
 *
 * @property {number} nanos
 *   Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative
 *   second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values
 *   that count forward in time. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999
 *   inclusive.
